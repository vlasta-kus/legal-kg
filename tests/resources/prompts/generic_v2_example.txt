SO2 MEETING ON 11/15/91, PARIS
Held with Dr. John Snow (CEO) and Mary Hodge, VP of Engineering.
Consensus on sulfur dioxide (SO2) not posing risk at low level chronic exposure, given available data from BCG report, though we were advised about possible links to birth defects in unborn babies in some cases.
I believe we shall eventually eliminate all emissions of SO2 at our manufacturing sites.
Based on information we developed 11/5/91, detectable levels of SO2 are in Provence water systems. Due to planned changes in the stainless and carbon steel manufacturing process, SO2 air emissions are expected to rise from 1000 lbs./yr. to 2300 lbs./yr.
Note that there is already likely SpaceX's liability for past 10 years of operations.
We were also claimed responsible for cyanide leak but that was quickly discarded as absurd.
