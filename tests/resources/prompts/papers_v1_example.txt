Abstract
Perfluorinated chemicals (PFASs) have been detected in the upper Midwest and the state of Minnesota in the USA. We hypothesized
that fish with high levels of PFASs in the Twin Cities Metro Areas would show adverse effects, such as oxidative
and general stress. The lowest concentrations of PFASs were found in largemouth bass from Steiger and Upper Prior Lakes
and the highest concentrations found in fish from Calhoun and Twin Lakes. Largemouth bass with high PFAS exhibited changes
in the expression of genes related to lipid metabolism and RNA processing. However, it is unlikely that PFASs are the only
stressors. Twin Lake is affected by the Joslyn superfund site which contains polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and pentachlorophenol.
These compounds are also expected to drive the transcriptomics responses observed, but to what degree is difficult
to ascertain at this time.
