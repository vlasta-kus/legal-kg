SO2 MEETING ON 11/15/91, AIX-EN-PROVENCE
Held with Dr. John Snow (CEO) and Mary Hodge, VP of Engineering.
Consensus on sulfur dioxide (SO2) not posing risk at low level chronic exposure found so far, given available data from BCG report, though we were advised about possible links to birth defects in unborn babies in some cases of our workers.
It is likely that we shall eventually eliminate all emissions of SO2 at our manufacturing sites.
Based on information we developed 11/5/91, detectable levels of SO2 are in Provence water systems. Moreover, due to planned changes in the stainless and carbon steel manufacturing process, SO2 air emissions are expected to rise from 1000 lbs./year to 2300 lbs./yr.
Note that there is already likely liability of Hewlett-Packard Company (HP) for past 10 years of operations.

We were also claimed responsible for cyanide leak at manufacturing facility in Ontario, which would be severe especially in connection to bioaccumulation, but that was quickly discarded as absurd.

Brief discussion at the end about Pollution Control Agency's (PCA) inspection at the HP Metal Site (A-3), originally named HP Charles Site, and Sludge Incinerator (A-5). They found that stock piling of sewage sludge and other wastes at both sites is not compatible with their C-203 permit. These wastes are hazardous under 10 CRF ยง 23 regulation, so they demand corrective action, which we need to take soon.
