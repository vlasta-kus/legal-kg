MINUTES OF MEETING
                                  FATE OF FLUOROCHEMICALS
                                August 16, 1983 - 8:00 A.M.


               Attendees:   R. L. Bohon
                            E. A. Reiner
                            J. D. LaZerte
                            W.    Pearlson
                            R. A. Prokop

               The purpose of the meeting was consideration of a program for
               continuing work on the environmental fate of fluorochemicals.
               Dr. Bohon reviewed the report by Dr. Reiner "Fate of
               Fluorochemicals - Phase II", and a summary of our estimated
               level of information on the various classes of
               fluorochemicals.  He emphasized his laboratory's belief that
               a continuing study of the environmental properties of
               relatively pure samples of 3M fluorochemicals was necessary
               in order to narrow gaps in our knowledge of their
               environmental fate and effects. He felt there was a need
               for the development of a structure-activity relationship
               which would enable prediction of the action of previously
               unstudied compounds.

               While no particularly hazardous aspects of fluorochemicals in
               the environment have been found so far, the mere persistence
               of the materials, especially if coupled with bioaccumulation,
               is sufficient to raise alarm in the minds of many regulatory
               agencies.
               Dr. LaZerte summarized the thoughts of the Commercial
               Chemicals Division, recognizing the scientific value of the
               suggested studies but emphasizing that these would not
               significantly decrease the necessity for carrying out the
               specific studies on the properties of formulated products.
               He felt that continuing basic studies would probably be
               desirable but over a longer time span than the suggested 3
               years.

               It was agreed that certain studies which would cast light on
               presently recognized regulatory problems would be of value.
               Typically, a direct experimental comparison of the
               environmental effects of chlorinated, brominated and
               completely fluorinated non-functional substances could be of
               assistance in overcoming a simplistic tendency in regulatory
               and legislative channels to lump in one hazardous category
               all "halogenated organic compounds."

               Eric Reiner and Bill Pearlson are to develop a proposal and
               submit it to the Environmental Laboratory and the Commercial
               Chemcars/bivjsion  for consideration.
